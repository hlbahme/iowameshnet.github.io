<p class="lead mt-5">IowaMesh.net is a group working to build a mesh network of Meshtastic radios in the State of Iowa. This network acts like a statewide text messaging system, allowing people to communicate publicly or privately with anyone on the network.</p>

Meshtastic is an open-source, decentralized, off-grid mesh network. It's made up of small communicators that can form a mesh network.
These communicators can be linked to a phone via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.
Meshtastic uses inexpensive LoRa radios as a long-range communication platform.
Learn more at the official Meshtastic website.
